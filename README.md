### Initialize virtual environment

```cmd
py -m venv venv

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Check ping to Paradex API server

Ping is the main parameter that will affect the bot's speed and, accordingly, its competitiveness with other bots.

For minimal ping, I recommend hosting the bot on servers located in Tokyo (AWS AP-NORTHEAST-1).
